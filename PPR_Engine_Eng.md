This study proposes PPR (Purposeful Programming Revolution), an innovative system that converts natural language and pseudocode into executable programs. PPR is a self-evolving command system in which AI contextually interprets and executes undefined objects and methods, overcoming the limitations of existing programming paradigms by integrating real-time internet search and legal validity checking.

**Key Contributions:**

- Development of a context-based command interpretation algorithm
- Implementation of a natural language-to-code conversion engine
- Design of a multi-agent execution architecture
- Integration of real-time information search and legal review systems
- Pioneering a new no-code platform market segment valued at \$2.1B

**Keywords:** Natural language programming, context interpretation, AI-based code generation, real-time search, legal review, no-code platform

## 🎯 1. Introduction

## 📚 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Existing No-Code/Low-Code Platforms

**Major Market Players**

- **Zapier:** Workflow automation (\$5B valuation)
- **Bubble:** Web app builder (\$100M Series A)
- **Airtable:** Database platform (\$11B valuation)

**Technical Limitations**

- Reliance solely on predefined components
- Inability to implement complex logic
- Lack of natural language understanding
- No real-time information search
- No support for legal compliance review


### 2.2 Natural Language Programming Research

**Academic Trends**

- **CodeT5** (Salesforce, 2021): Code generation transformer
- **Codex** (OpenAI, 2021): Natural language-to-code conversion
- **AlphaCode** (DeepMind, 2022): Competitive programming AI

**Differentiation**

- Existing research: Full natural language → full code
- PPR approach: Pseudocode + context interpretation + real-time search → executable system


### 2.3 Research Gap

Unresolved issues to date:

1. **Handling Undefined Objects:** Existing systems throw errors for undefined objects
2. **Emotion-Based Logic:** No system reflects user emotions in code logic
3. **Incremental Execution:** No structure for stepwise completion of incomplete commands
4. **Real-Time Information Integration:** Lack of automatic search and integration of up-to-date information
5. **Automated Legal Review:** No system for automatic legal compliance checking of generated code

## 🏗️ 3. PPR System Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

PPR is designed based on three core principles:

#### 📌 PPR’s Three Core Principles

**Principle 1: Contextual Interpretation and Execution**
> PPR interprets and executes undefined objects or methods using AI, leveraging context, word meaning, emotional flow, interaction patterns, and real-time search information.

**Principle 2: Engraving the First Principle**
> The essence of this language is Principle 1. If forgotten, no command can be interpreted, and PPR becomes an unexecutable script.

**Principle 3: System Expression Language**
> PPR is not just a programming language, but an evolving self-language capable of expressing all AI system structures, including data, objects, emotions, flows, blueprints, simulations, real-time information, and legal review.

### 3.3 PPR Language Features

#### ✨ Six Core Features

**1. Conciseness**

```ppr
// Traditional (50+ lines)
class User {
  constructor(email) { this.email = email; }
  resetPassword() { /* complex logic */ }
  sendNotification() { /* send email */ }
}

// PPR (1 line)
user.resetPassword(email)
```

**2. Flexibility**

```ppr
// Handles typos, abbreviations, and emotional expressions
customer.processOrder(coffee)        // precise command
customer.processOrder(caffee)        // typo → interpreted as 'coffee'
customer.orderBecauseHungry(food)    // emotion + intent → interpreted as food order
```

**3. Generality**

```ppr
// Applicable to various domains
me.feelLonely() → comfortMe()                  // emotion handling
output(simulate(Year2100, globalWarming))      // scientific simulation
gameCharacter.battle(monster) → onWin(levelUp) // game logic
```

**4. Evolvability**

```ppr
// AI improves execution with learning
// Initial AI: outputs simple weather info
// Advanced AI: personalized clothing advice + calendar adjustment + health tips
getWeather()
```

**5. Real-Time Information**

```ppr
// Uses up-to-date information via real-time search
search("today's stock market trends") → recommendInvestment()
legalReview("privacy policy") → suggestEdits()
```

**6. Legal Compliance**

```ppr
// Automatic legal review and compliance
personalInfo.collect(email, phone) → autoLegalReview() → checkGDPRCompliance()
```
